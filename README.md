# Introduction
## Purpose
iLike-IL is an application designed to elevate the level of awareness and understanding of the State
of Israel. All around the world public opinion is determined by the media, which often presents a one-sided picture. In many places Israel, despite its size and population, is considered to be the biggest threat to world peace.
iLike-IL is an advocacy application designed to allow users an easy way to search and comment on
articles related to Israel.
Combined with an aiding toolkit the user can easily find relevant tips and videos, and thus post a
more knowledgeable talkback for other readers to see.
Moreover- with simple modifications to the search criterions, the application can be used as a PR application, designed to find articles on any particular issues (i.e McDonalds, Toyota, etc.) and allow company representatives to comment on that issue.
Currently, there is a lot of interest in the application from different organizations that deals with
Israeli advocacy. Our main cooperation is with StandWithUS, one of the biggest organizations
in the field. We are in contact directly with the manger in Israel who promised us full support
publishing the site.

## Scope
The goal of this application is to allow an easy and convenient way to search articles which contain talk-backs, and aid the user to post knowledgeable comments.
Registered users can save and track history of their activities, including articles they commented on, marked as favorites and/or marked as relevant/irrelevant.
In addition- users, and especially preferred users and admins- can effect on the articles ranking and relevance with their ranking

#Architecture
##Overview
Our application was designed so that it could easily be changed to be a different PR application- by simply changing the keywords used for the article searching and analysis, the application can allow searching of articles on about any subject, thus allowing company representatives to easily find and comment on negative articles on their company.
